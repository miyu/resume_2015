    <p>Dear Rioters,</p>
    <p>
      I’m applying for another internship at Riot! I am Riot through-and-through: I attack problems from unexpected angles with constant iteration and experimentation, have a healthy disregard for what is conventional, and strongly believe in delivering awesome to players.  Fostered by Riot’s player-focused approach, I’ve spent the last three and a half years developing player-focused applications to facilitate the creation, distribution, and installation of League of Legends modifications. Through these projects, I’ve found problems to solve, mentors to learn with, and opportunities to grow and refine my character and craft.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began developing third-party League of Legends tools on April 28th 2011, when Udyr published the Riot Archive File specification. Hours later, I released utilities enabling fellow players to dump and pack client resources, and in time RAF Manager performed millions of user-friendly modification installations per month and provided developers utilities for data-mining applications.  On the side, I maintained an orphaned colorblind modification project and eventually facilitated the production of League of Legends’ “Colorblind Mode” implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      RAF Manager and the RADS Patcher were incompatible, often corrupting users’ game installations. On August 26th, 2012, I released an early build of RAF Manager’s successor, Dargon, which avoided conflicts with the patcher by applying modifications through API interception. One year later, Dargon ‘powered’ Leaguepedia’s Pros Play for the Philippines charity event, placing sponsor logos into the world of Runeterra and running HUD overlays pushing donations. In time, I brought my work to AzubuTV and interned at Riot for a summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      From its interview process onward, Riot challenged and refined everything from my definition of a team and mentor to my capabilities as an engineer. While I struggled at various times throughout my internship, I left with a pile of book recommendations and a plethora of engineering topics to explore; I’m still learning day-by-day, refining my craft and interpersonal skills. To me, another summer means another chance to test my character and chops with guaranteed feedback and mentorship, another chance to have my perspective flipped upside down, and another chance to work in the most player-focused company in the world. I still don’t know the true definition of leadership or the best way to develop world-class software, but I’m eager to find out. Please consider me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sincerely,
    </p>
    <p>
